<h1>Tour of the Solar System</h1>
<h2>January 11, 2024</h2>
<p>Today we have set off from earth to go on a journy around our solar system. I'm a bit nervous but excited for the scientific discoveries that will be made along the way. Before we set off, I triple checked we had all our important supllies on the ship. Some such supplies were:
    Spacesuits
    Food/Water
    Scientific Instruments
    Entertainment
    Repair Supplies
    This is sure to be some adventure. I've already taken this fabulous photo of earth.

<p>We have reached the sun. The goal is to slingshot around it and launch ourselves far into the solar system. The faculae sure are blinding being this close to the sun. I'm excited to carry on past it though. I've ranked the various celestial bodies we will visit in order from most excited to least excited. 
    Saturn
    Jupiter
    Mars
    Uranus
    Venus
    Earth
    Mercury
    Moon
    Neptune
    Sun 
    I can't wait to view the Kirkwood Gaps and see first hand if there really is an Oort Cloud.
    Faculae-Bright patches that are visible on the Sun's surface, or photosphere
    Kirkwood Gaps-Regions in the main belt of asteroids where few or no asteroids are found
    Oort Cloud-A theoretical shell of comets that is believed to exist at the outermost regions of our solar system

<p>We've finally reached Saturn, the celestial body I was looking forward to the most. I can't believe it's been about 22 months since we left earth. It feels like it was only yesterday. I captured this beautiful picture of Saturn yesterday.
