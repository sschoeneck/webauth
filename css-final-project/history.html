            The area around Jackson was first populated by white settlers in the early 1840s.
            Jackson was founded on January 21, 1846.
            It took its name after the recently dead Andrew Jackson. 
            Jackson was originally comprised of several small hamlets, one of which was Kirchhayn.
            Kirchhayn began growing due to David's Star Lutheran Church. 
            Another of these hamlets was Riceville, named after Franz Reis. 
            Riceville would later become the village of Jackson. 
            As a railroad was being built from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac, Reis offered his property as a depot.
            As the railroad grew, Reis built several buildings around the depot, developing the area.
            In 1912, the Jackson hamlet was incorporated into a village.
            Over time, Jackson has continued to expand and grow in population.
            As of 2024, Jackson, Wi has a population of 8,102 people.
